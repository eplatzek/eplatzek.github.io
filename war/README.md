==================
The Game of War.
- For 2-52 players
- Each player plays a card from their deck
- Top card wins all other cards
- If there is a tie, there is a war between tied parties
- If a player cannot contribute a card to the play or the flop, they have lost

Created as a demo of vanilla javascript problem solving
- console.log outputs each round's results
