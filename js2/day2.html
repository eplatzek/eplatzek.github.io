Day 2: Arrays
<ul>
	<li>Arrays!
        <ul>
            <li>What are indexes</li>
            <li>2D Array</li>
        <ul>Array Manipulation
            <li>Push, Pop, Slice</li>

            <li><xmp>Examples:
var days = new Array("Monday", "Tuesday", "Friday");

//Better practice due to readablity and speed
var cars = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Friday"]; 

//The length property returns the number of elements in days
var x = days.length;

//The sort() method sort days in alphabetical order         
var y = days.sort();
         
//Push adds a new element (Saturday) to days
days.push("Saturday");                

var index, text;
for	(index = 0; index < days.length; index++) {
    text += days[index];
}
                                    
//Removes the last element of an array and returns that element if it's used in an assigmnement statement.               
var lastday = days.pop(); 

//Removes the first element of the array and shifts all elements down the index.
var firstday = days.shift(); 

//Don't use this as it will leave holes in the array. Index 0 will be undefined
delete days[0]; 
                                    
//The first parameter (2) defines the position where new elements should be added (spliced in).
//The second parameter (0) defines how many elements should be removed.
//The rest of the parameters ("Sunday", "Thursday") define the new elements to be added.
days.splice(2, 0, "Sunday", "Thursday"); 
                                                                    
//We can add two arrays together                                                                        
var myFruit = ["Apple", "Pear"];
var myVeggies = ["Cucumber", "Peas"];
var myFood = myVeggies.concat(myFruit);

//The slice() method selects elements starting at the start argument, and ends at, but does not include, the end argument.
var theseFoods = myFood.slice(1, 3); 
//If the last argument is omitted, the slice() method slices out the rest of the array.                                    
// Sorts the elements of myFood alphabetically                       \
myFood.sort();

<ol><b>Coding Challenge</b><br/>
We will be modifying our Day 1 Code<br/><br/>
    <li>First Challenge: Instead of two text input boxes we will have one input box. The one input box will take take any number of input strings. We will parse that data and input it into an array. In the response area output that array and each element's index</br>
    <b>Hint: Depending on your seperator (commas or spaces) you can use the split command to break a string apart. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp</a></b>
    </li>
    <li>Second Challenge: Our client decided that they still want the ability to determine the longest sting or biggest number. From that array display which ever is bigger, either the longest string(based on length) or biggest number. <br/> 
    </li> 
    <li>Third Challenge: Our client wants us to sort our array and out the top 3 biggest entries in our array. Strings will be compared by size, if the sizes are equal sizes should be alphabetically sorted. Our client also really wants those numbers to be equilivent to length of a string. With equal size string and equal number, have the number first in the list<br/>
    Example: Typed = cat kitten 1 3 dog<br/>
            Result = kitten 3 cat (the "dog 1" would not be printed because we only want the top three).<br/>
    </li>
    <li>BONUS: Create you own split function which takes any delimiter and use that instead. Allow the user to tell you what delimter they wish to use. </li>
