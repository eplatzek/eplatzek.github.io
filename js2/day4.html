Day 4: Objects
<ul>
	<li>Objects
        <ul>
            <li>What are objects</li>
            <li>Vars and Methods:</br>
            JavaScript objects are containers for variables and functions.</br>
            The variables inside of an object are called properties.</br>
            The inside of a object are called methods.</br>
            The properties are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).</br>
</li>
            <li><xmp>Examples:
var car = {make:"Honda", model:"Civic", color:"white", year:2012};
                
//We can also add methods to an object              
var car = {make:"Honda", model:"Civic", color:"white", year:2012, description:function() {return "I'm a description!!";}}

//We can call that method
car.description()            


//We can also add methods to an object and use the ".this" to reference properties inside of our object                
var car = {make:"Honda", model:"Civic", color:"white", year:2012, description:function() {return this.make + " " + this.model;}}
</xmp>
<hr>                                                                                    
<xmp>                                                                                                                              
//Let's say we have many objects. We can create a "constructor" to make new objects. 
//We are using the "this." notation to create variables. "this." creates public variables.
                
function Car(make, model, year, color) {
    this.myMake = make;  
    this.myModel = model;
    this.myYear = year;
    this.myColor = color;
    this.changeColor = function (Newcolor) {
        this.color = Newcolor;
    }
}
                
var myCar = new Car("honda","civic",2012,"white");

//Let's give it a paint job!
myCar.changeColor("red");
                     
//We are using the "this." syntax to allow our object to have public properties. 
//These are properites we can access outside of our object using the dot notation.
//For example:
myCar.year  

//We have two way to reference public properties::
objectName.propertyName
objectName["propertyName"]

The second way is useful if we want to access propertes on the fly by passing strings
var myProp = "myColor"
myCar[myProp]
     
//It is a good idea to make an object's properties private so that only the object's properties. 
//In this way only methods and other properties inside of an object an access that variable. 
//To make a property private use the "var" notation instead of "this." notation. 
//If we also want to access a property outside of the object we can create funtions with do that, we call these functions setters and getters.

Here is an example of where we have a setter andgettor for the numbers of rooms.       
function House (rooms, colors){
  
   //myRoom is now private
   var myRoom = rooms;
   this.myColor = colors;
   
   //Here is an example of doing something other than a simple assignment to a private variable
   var mySize = rooms * 10;
   
   //This is my setter
   this.setRoom = function(newRoom){
       myRoom = newRoom;
   }
   
   //This is my getter
   this.getRoom = function(){
       return myRoom;
   }
}


var bitwise = new House (4, "blue");

//We can set and get the room variable like this:
bitwise.getRoom();
bitwise.setRoom(9);


//We can also use variables when creating a new object:
var myBlue = "blue";
var bitwise2 = new House (4, myBlue);

<ol><b><u>Coding Challenge</u></b><br/>We want to create an address book which will be filled with contacts.
    <li>First Challenge: Create html page with input fields to create new contact (first name, last name, phone, etc.)
</li>
    <li>Second Challenge: Create a button to “save” your contact you just created. Hint: You will need an array to store your created "contacts" each button press should create a new contact and add it to that array. 
    <li>Third Challenge: Create a button to that displays a list of all of your contacts using DOM manipulation.
    <li>Fourth Challenge: Create a search bar to search for contacts and display the ones that match. Hint: You will need to iterate through the array of "contacts" and do a string compare on the matching field/field(s)
