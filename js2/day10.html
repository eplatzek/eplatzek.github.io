Day 10: Assigning a Final Project
<ul>
	<li>Synopsis: </br> As an exercise in AngularJS, we would like an application that will help a team of developers communicate about the projects they are currently working on.  The application should communicate high level information such as what projects are being worked on, who is working on those projects, when it will be done and current status.  
    </li>
    <li>Scope:
        <ol>
            <li>need to see all projects that are part of this “board”</li>
            <li>must be able to edit all project details: title, description, team, estimated due date</br>NOTES: should not save until user explicitly saves</li>
            <li>must be able to change the status of a project (not started, on track, delayed, completed)</li>
            <li>must be able to add comments to a project/br>NOTES: new comments should not be saved until user explicitly saves</li>
            <li>should be able to view all comments for a project</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Bonus:
        <ol>
            <li>Date picker for due date.</li>
            <li>should be able to add an indicator (tag?) to each team member to indicate their role: project owner, client stakeholder, designer, tester, etc.</li>
            <li>hyperlink support in comments</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Suggestions:
        <ul>
            <li>You may want to use some sort of modal dialog for edits. At a minimum, there should be a way to “cancel” an edit and to “save” changes.</li>
            <li>Since we don't have a node or mongo create the users as an array in your static data.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
